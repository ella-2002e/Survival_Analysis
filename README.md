Survival Analysis using parametric modelling


Introduction:

Welcome to the Survival Analysis Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for survival analysis using AFT (Accelerated Failure Time) modeling and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or enthusiast, this space provides tools and insights to analyze time-to-event data and make predictions crucial for various applications.

Survival Analysis:

The core of this repository is the "survival_analysis" file. Immerse yourself in the world of survival analysis using AFT modeling, a powerful technique for understanding the time until an event of interest occurs. Explore different parametric models to gain insights into survival patterns and leverage the predictive capabilities of AFT models for more accurate time-to-event predictions.

Additionally, CLV prediction is integrated within the survival analysis framework. Customer Lifetime Value is a key metric for businesses, and its fusion with survival analysis offers valuable insights into customer retention, acquisition strategies, and overall business sustainability.

Report:

The "report" file functions as a demonstration and detailed explanation of the codes. Inside, you'll find a step-by-step walkthrough of the implemented analysis, demonstrating how to apply AFT modeling for survival analysis and predict CLV. The report aims to be both informative and accessible, providing a clear understanding of the methodologies used and the results obtained.
