Survival Analysis using parametric modelling


Introduction:

Welcome to the Survival Analysis Repository! This repository is a comprehensive resource for survival analysis using AFT (Accelerated Failure Time) modeling and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or enthusiast, here you'll find tools and insights to analyze time-to-event data and make predictions crucial for various applications.

Survival Analysis:

The heart of this repository lies in the "survival_analysis" file. Dive into the world of survival analysis using AFT modeling, a powerful technique for understanding the time until an event of interest occurs. Explore different parametric models to gain insights into survival patterns, and harness the predictive capabilities of AFT models for more accurate time-to-event predictions.

Additionally, we've included CLV prediction within the survival analysis framework. Customer Lifetime Value is a key metric for businesses, and integrating it with survival analysis can provide valuable insights into customer retention, acquisition strategies, and overall business sustainability.

Report:

The "report" file serves as a demonstration and detailed explanation of the codes. In this file, you'll find a walk-through of the implemented analysis, showcasing how to apply AFT modeling for survival analysis and predict CLV. The report is designed to be both informative and accessible, providing a clear understanding of the methodologies used and the results obtained.
